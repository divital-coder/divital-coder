**Building at the intersection of spatial intelligence, neurosymbolic reasoning, and scientific computing.**

I am a 21-year-old researcher working across deep learning, scientific machine learning, and 3D spatial reasoning. My work is driven by a conviction that the next generation of intelligent systems must unify geometric perception, symbolic abstraction, and physically grounded world models — bridging the gap between pattern recognition and genuine understanding of spatiotemporal structure.

I am an active open-source contributor in the Julia and Python scientific computing ecosystems, with sustained contributions to the JuliaHealth and SciML organisations.

## Proficiency in Real-Time 3D Video and Spatial Intelligence

My core research focus lies in real-time 3D video understanding and spatial intelligence. I work extensively with monocular depth estimation, Gaussian splatting, and neural radiance fields — methods that reconstruct and reason about 3D scenes from 2D observations. My interest extends beyond static reconstruction to the temporal dimension: building spatiotemporal scene representations that capture how environments evolve over time, enabling embodied agents to perceive, predict, and act within dynamic physical worlds.

This line of work connects directly to the emerging field of world models — learned simulators of environment dynamics that allow agents to plan and imagine future states before committing to action. I am particularly interested in architectures that learn structured latent representations of physical dynamics, combining the expressivity of deep generative models with the compositionality of symbolic physics priors.

## Neurosymbolic and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

I am deeply invested in the design of novel symbolic-hierarchical reinforcement learning architectures. The central question motivating this work is: how can we build agents that discover and exploit compositional structure in their environments, rather than learning flat, monolithic policies?

My approach draws from neurosymbolic AI — combining neural perception and continuous control with discrete symbolic program induction. This enables agents to learn abstract, transferable skills organized into task hierarchies, where high-level symbolic planners delegate to learned low-level controllers. The goal is not merely sample efficiency, but genuine compositional generalisation: agents that can recombine previously learned concepts to solve novel tasks zero-shot.

## Scientific Machine Learning and Medical Imaging

I have made sustained contributions to the Julia scientific computing ecosystem, particularly within the [JuliaHealth](https://github.com/JuliaHealth) and [SciML](https://github.com/SciML) organisations. My work in this space spans medical image processing, volumetric segmentation, and differentiable scientific computing.

I developed [MedImages.jl](https://github.com/divital-coder/MedImages.jl), a library for BIDS-format medical image loading with ITK wrapper functions, supporting image transformations and format conversion pipelines critical for reproducible medical imaging research. I also authored [SupervoxelSegmentation](https://github.com/divital-coder/SupervoxelSegmentation), a native Julia implementation of supervoxel segmentation algorithms for volumetric data — a foundational building block for 3D medical image analysis.

Beyond medical imaging, my scientific ML work includes contributions to data interpolation methods, SciML benchmarks, and operator-based scientific computing frameworks.

## Machine Learning and Computer Vision

In applied machine learning, I built [Leaf-Effects](https://github.com/divital-coder/Leaf-Effects), a hierarchical vision transformer for detecting leaf diseases, incorporating patch embeddings, hierarchical feature stages, and feature pyramid networks for multi-scale detection. I also developed a complete [ML pipeline for predicting water quality indicators](https://github.com/divital-coder/EY-Water-Quality-Prediction) from Landsat satellite imagery and TerraClimate data for the EY Open Science Data Challenge.

My work on [cryoet-tomogram-search-agent](https://github.com/divital-coder/cryoet-tomogram-search-agent) demonstrates my interest in AI-augmented scientific workflows — building intelligent agents that navigate CZI's CryoET datasets and retrieve relevant tomograms from natural language queries, bridging the gap between researchers and complex scientific data repositories.

## Technical Tooling and Open-Source Utilities

I maintain several open-source tools that reflect my broader engineering interests. [aibase-scraper](https://github.com/divital-coder/aibase-scraper) is a Rust-powered web scraper with a React frontend for AI research news aggregation. [PosterGuild](https://github.com/divital-coder/PosterGuild) is a research-paper-to-poster generation application. [Julez-Dash](https://github.com/divital-coder/Julez-Dash) demonstrates data-intensive web applications built on the Dash framework in Julia.
